ODAE: Ontology of Drug Adverse Events

The ODAE is developed as a biomedical ontology in the area of drug adverse events. It is developed by following OBO Foundry principles (e.g., openness, collaboration).

The ODAE is primarily developed in the Oliver He laboratory at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA. Professor Yu Lin and her colleagues from Guizhou Provincial People's Hospital and Guizhou University Medical College, Guiyang, Guizhou, China, also contributed significantly to the development of ODAE and its use cases.
